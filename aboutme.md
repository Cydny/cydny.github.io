My name is Chris and this is website is an attempt to document my activity during my PhD so that I can keep track my progress (or lack thereof).
> Only what gets measured gets done.

I will delve into subjects of (theoretical) computer science and mathematics such as
- logic - DL (description logics) in particular
- OWL (Web Ontology Language)
- knowledge representation formalisms 
- patterns of all kinds
- functional programming
- vim

I am new to the game of knowledge representation and the whole ecosystem revolving around DL and OWL. A lot of things don't make sense to me yet. Feel free to laugh at my pain while you see me struggle!
