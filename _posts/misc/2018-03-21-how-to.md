1. This blog is generated by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). Install it and then simply use it.
2. The standard generated template will have a few things will want to modify. This is mostly done in the `\_config.yml`. Do yourself a favour and take a second to check the documentation.  
3. Setting up categories for your posts is not covered in the documentation. Maybe it isâ€”it probably is. Stubborn "past me" didn't bother with the documentation but figured out the way described here.
    * create a folder `categories`
    * for each category create a  `categoryName.html` file with the following input
    ```
    ---
    layout: page
    title: categoryName
    ---

    {% for post in site.categories.categoryName %}
     <li><span>{{ post.date | date_to_string }}</span> &nbsp; <a href="{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a></li>
    {% endfor %}
    ```
    * now you can use `categories: categoryName` in your posts
4. You most certainly need a way to write some math. [This](http://sgeos.github.io/github/jekyll/2016/08/21/adding_mathjax_to_a_jekyll_github_pages_blog.html) worked for you and I will repeat the instructions here:
    * Add the following code to `\_include/mathjax.html`
    ```
    {% if page.mathjax %}
    <script type="text/x-mathjax-config">
     MathJax.Hub.Config({
      tex2jax: {
       inlineMath: [ ['$','$'], ["\\(","\\)"] ],
       processEscapes: true
      }
     });
    </script>
    <script
     type="text/javascript"
     charset="utf-8"
     src="https://cdn.mathjax.org/mathjax/latest/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS-MML_HTMLorMML"
    >
    </script>
    <script
     type="text/javascript"
     charset="utf-8"
     src="https://vincenttam.github.io/javascripts/MathJaxLocal.js"
    >
    </script>
    {% endif %}
    ```
    * Add the following line to the header in `\_layouts/post.html` or anywhere else you want to use MathJax.
    ```
    {% include mathjax.html %}
    ```

    * Add the following line to the YAML front matter of a post to enable MathJax on a post by post basis.
    ```
    mathjax: true
    ```
